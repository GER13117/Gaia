# Mountain Run
Mountain Run is a small jump and run / PVP game.
### How the game works.
You have to play it with two Players. One takes WASD and the other one the Arrow-Keys and the mouse.<br />
The one who took the Arrow-Keys and the Mouse is the hunter:<br />
His goal is to block the Runner, which is to run out of side of the hunter. But watch out: The Hunter is significant less maneuverable. So be fast.

3. If the startMenu is blank-white, resize your window to fix it. The same goes with the end-screen.
